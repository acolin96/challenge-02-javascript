## Description
I was tasked with creating a random password generator. I created a requirement of between 8-128 characters where the user can choose to use upper case, lower case, numeric, and special characters. It is prompted with a confirm or cancel message asking if the user would like to use said characters. The user can choose all, 1, 2, or 3 and the it will randomly generate the password for them.
